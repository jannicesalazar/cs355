            The sun is about 1000 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider than Jupiter, the biggest planet.

            The sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it - the planets, asteriods, comets, and tiny bits of space debris.

            Nothing could live on the sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth.
