            The sun is about 100 times wider than Earth and about 10 times wider than Jupiter, the biggest planet.
            <br>
            <br>
            The sun is the only star in our solar system. It is the center of our solar system, and its gravity holds the solar system together. Everything in our solar system revolves around it - the planets, asteriods, comets, and tiny bits of space debris. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            Nothing could live on the sun, but its energy is vital for most life on Earth. 
            <br>
            <br> 
            The sun completes one rotation of its equator in 25 Earth days.
            <br>
            <br> 
            The sun does not actually have a solid surface because it's a ball of plasma.   
            <br>
            <br> 
            The temperature in the Sun's core is about 27 million degrees Farenheit (15 million degrees Celsius) which creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing.
